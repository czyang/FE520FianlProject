## Topic
Build a regression package (Using Class)
1. A linear regression
2. non linear regression
3. Output statistic value for regression (p value, t-test, F-test, R square, AIC...)

1. Topic: Regression Package Implementation and Test

2. Motivation and insights expect from data analysis:
In this project, we are focusing on implementing regression class and statistic tool building. As regression is a powerful tool in data analysis, we apply it to solve real problems.

We find a housing data set. House attributes include floors, bedroom number, living space, location, year of built, housing price and so on. We have already divided it into train set and test set. Our model will be tested. And it will show us how these house attributes impact on housing price. 

3.Related Work:
Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning. ChristopherBishop, Springer, 2006 as algorithm implementation guide.

4.Methodology:
There are three ways to find linear regression fitting functions. Gradient Descent, Newtonâ€™s Law and Normal Equation. The class will mainly rely on Gradient Descent. And we will try other methods if time is sufficient.

5.Project Plan:
The entire project will be divided into three parts, including linear regression class implementation, no-linear regression class implementation and statistic tools. Those three parts will be distributed to our group members.Classes and tools will be tested against data set. Essential meta data and results will be represented graphically.


### Feedback
This is easy. please refer https://www.statsmodels.org/dev/examples/notebooks/generated/ols.html I expect you can calculate all thing similar with summary table.
